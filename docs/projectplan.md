# Summary

This project will provide a utility for indivduals looking to both earn some money and get simple tasks finished. Users will be able to post jobs they need finished such as mowing lawns, raking leaves, and shoveling snow. Task posters also declare how much they are willing to pay for them to be finished. Other users looking for work can sign up to do these tasks. The application requires a way for employers to communicate with potential employees as well as a way for users to pay each other for the work when it is finished. 

# Team Organization

The project will be stored on GitHub and all members of the team will be made contributors. As tasks and improvements are decided on, team members should create a new branch specific to that task and merge it when that task is fully functional. All members of the team will be expected to contribute to every sprint as according to the tasks assigned from the Scrum Master. Specific roles and tasks will be discussed as a team and assigned when we start work on the next sprint. Communication will be conducted primarily in the Discord group. 

# Software Development Process

The development will be broken up into five phases.  Each phase will be a little like a Sprint in an Agile 
method and a little like an iteration in a Spiral process.  Specifically, each phase will be like a Sprint, in 
that work to be done will be organized into small tasks, placed into a “backlog”, and prioritized.   Then, 
using on time-box scheduling, the team will decide which tasks the phase (Sprint) will address.  The 
team will use a Scrum Board to keep track of tasks in the backlog, those that will be part of the current 
Sprint, those in progress, and those that are done.
Each phase will also be a little like an iteration in a Spiral process, in that each phase will include some 
risk analysis and that any development activity (requirements capture, analysis, design, implementation, 
etc.) can be done during any phase.  Early phases will focus on understanding (requirements capture and 
analysis) and subsequent phases will focus on design and implementation.  Each phase will include a 
retrospective.
### Phase Iteration
1. Phase 1 - Requirements Capture
2. Phase 2 - Analysis, Architectural, UI, and DB Design
3. Phase 3 - Implementation, and Unit Testing
4. Phase 4 - More Implementation and Testing  

We will use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to document user goals, structural concepts, component 
interactions, and behaviors.

# Communication Policies, Tools and Procedures

## Policies
We will be using Discord as our main form of communication when not present together. We will also be using text, messaging, and in person meetings to augment our communication as a team.

## Procedures
For our project procedures, we will be using the Jira ticket system to maintain task and project organization. Each week, the Scrum Master will maintain the Jira group and assign users to their various tasks. The group as a whole will identify the tasks that need to be completed in a time frame and rely on the Scrum Master to update the board accordingly.

## Tools
* Discord Server
* SMS Text Messaging
* In-person Meetings


# Risk Analysis

Risk analysis will focus on user security and data protection. Passwords will be salted and encrypted/ hashed to prevent plain-text storage. This means the project will **not** contain a table of passwords that can be plainly read and accessed by malicious users. Abstraction and encapsulation will both be employed to protect information of the app and prevent unwanted interception or access of nefarious users. Risk for the non-coded (real-life) elements of the application will be handled through the maintenance of records of all user's interactions with each other to provide assistance and information to law enforcement if necessary. A review system and history system will enable both Owners and Workers to see the validity and trustworthiness of their counterparts that they are working with through the app. User privacy of information will be maintained by hiding the information of a user until the necessary personal information (such as a physical address or contact information) is required for the task to be completed. Otherwise, personal information is hidden and protected by the application to ensure user security and safety.
