# Requirements
## Requirements Introduction and Context
This document contains the various requirements for the "Yoke" yard-care labor aid application. Contained in this document is this Introduction as a Context section detailing the general purpose of this application, a Users section detailing who may use this application and what their goals may be, a Functional Requirements section, a Non-Functional Requirements section, a section detailing possible Future Requirements/ Components, and a Glossary. The general Context of this application is the necessity for an application for both a property owner and a laborer to be able to communicate to arrange and confirm yardwork tasks with each other. The specific roles and goals of these users will be expanded upon in the next section. Additionally, this app will satisfy a number of requests and necessities decided and provided by the client commissioning the creation of this application. They will be detailed in this document concerning their feasibility and ability/ imperative to be accomplished.
## Users
There are two types of users that would use this application. They are as follows:
1. **Tasker:** This user is the property owner perspective of an individual with a job to be done. Their goal is to post a task or series of tasks and communicate with the worker to have said task(s) completed within a certain timeframe (as dictated by agreement between the Tasker and Worker) and to provide payment and feedback to the Worker upon completion of the labor. A Tasker may both provide reviews for a Worker as well as receive reviews for themselves.
2. **Worker:** This user is the commissioned freelance individual that completes a task or series of tasks provided by the Tasker. Their goal is to receive payment for their services and communicate with the Tasker concerning the timeframe in which the tasks are completed. They have the ability to provide proof of a job's completion, provide reviews for the Tasker and the Tasker's yard, and also receive reviews for themselves concerning their quality of work.
## Functional Requirements
These requirements require coding on behalf of the development team and will have direct correlation with such coded sections. Some of these requirements will be placed in a higher priority from the developers and may be implemented before other lower priority requirements.
- This Application **must** be mobile compatible. This is a functional requirement because it will require specific coding from the developers to adhere to mobile conditions
- This Application **must** allow user logins and authentication
- This Application **must** have separated Tasker and Worker sections and predefined roles
- This Application **must** have a way to post jobs as a Tasker
- This Application **must** have a way for Workers to accept listed jobs
- This Application **must** have a payment system between the Taskers and Workers
- This Application **must** have a system for Workers to notify Taskers that the job is completed
- This Application **must** have a predefined list of possible job types for Tasker listings
- This Application **must** have a system to define the timeframe by Taskers for job completion
- This Application **must** have a system to provide communication between Taskers and Workers
- This Application **must** use a GitHub repository
- This Application **should** provide a system for the Worker to prove the completion of their labor
- This Application **should** provide a system for the Tasker to dispute the completion of the labor
- This Application **should** provide a 2-way review system for both Taskers and Workers
- This Application **should** provide a system for the customer to provide contact information when a job is accepted by a Tasker 

## Nonfunctional Requirements
These requirements describe how the application runs and detail the ideal for a better user experience and more fully-developed application. However, they are not explicitly coded by the development team and are a biproduct of the development team's process.
* This project must adhere to the Agile method
* This project must exhibit adequate performance and efficiency
* This project must be reliable and exhibit user security and data integrity
* This project must exhibit a capacity for a significant group of users at any moment, anywhere in the range of 100-10,000 users at a time and maintain the data for all users in the entire lifetime of the application


## Future Features
These requirements are planned for if all other features are implemented and time remains for additionally added features. Additionally, these may be completed in a future commissioned development period. These features may be implemented for a possible improvement of the user experience and application as a whole. However, these are less of a priority and may or may not be functional requirements for the application and may be beyond the scope of this project.
- This Application **could** implement a tipping system in addition to the predefined payment system
- This Application **could** implement a history system for the Tasker and Worker to see the counterpart's history of listings/work on the application
- This Application **could** implement a blacklist system for the Tasker or Worker to avoid interaction with an opposing party in the future
- This Application **could** implement a preference system for the Tasker or Worker to increase likelihood of working with an opposing party in the future
- This Application **could** implement a premium-based system for additionally priced labor for Workers that provide an exceptional degree of labor, whether through equipment of a higher caliber or through professional expertise/ certification.
- This Application **could** implement a system detailing the map of the Tasker's area for reference by the Worker.
